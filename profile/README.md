# 🎼 👋 Welcome to the SKRID project!

SKRID Platform is a web-based interface for querying and exploring musical patterns stored in a graph database.

## Status
This organization is just a mirror of the main gitlab, and it will probably not be updated.

**Source repositories**: [https://gitlab.inria.fr/skrid](https://gitlab.inria.fr/skrid).

## Project structure
The project is divided into five repositories:
- [`client`](https://gitlab.inria.fr/skrid/client): the vueJS client interface
- [`frontend`](https://gitlab.inria.fr/skrid/frontend): the interface between the client and the backend
- [`backend`](https://gitlab.inria.fr/skrid/backend): the brain, query creation, conversion, result processing
- [`data-ingestion`](https://gitlab.inria.fr/skrid/data-ingestion): the data loader into the graph database
- [`skrid-deployment`](https://gitlab.inria.fr/skrid/skrid-deployment): orchestration to run the platform
